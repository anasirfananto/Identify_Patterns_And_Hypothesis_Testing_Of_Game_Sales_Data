# Identify_Patterns_And_Hypothesis_Testing_Of_Game_Sales_Data
# Project Description
You work at the online store "Ice" which sells video games from all over the world. Data related to user and expert game reviews , genre, platform (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical game sales data are available from open sources. You need to identify patterns that determine whether a game can be said to be successful or not. That way, you can find the games with the most potential and plan their advertising campaigns.
In front of you is data from 2016. Let's imagine that it is December 2016 and you are planning a campaign for 2017.
(Right now, the most important thing is for you to get experience working with data. It doesn't matter whether you forecast 2017 sales based on data from 2016 or forecast 2027 sales based on data from 2026.).
This dataset contains abbreviations. ESRB is an abbreviation for Entertainment Software Rating Board, which is an independent regulatory organization that evaluates game content and assigns age ratings such as Teen or Mature.
